## 🧭 About This Repository

I’ve built this tracker to **revise, practice, and measure progress** while preparing for SDE interviews.  
The structure is inspired by the real interview flow of top companies — **DSA ➜ CS Fundamentals ➜ System Design ➜ Full Stack ➜ Mocks**.

Each week includes:
- ✅ Curated LeetCode questions  
- 📘 Specific system design or backend task  
- 🕐 Measurable milestones (e.g., “Solve 20 array problems in <20 mins each”)  

You can find the full weekly breakdown in [`SDE_Interview_Prep.md`](./SDE_Interview_Prep.md).
